# Simulation Outputs

Full time histories of blade and tower/hub/nacelle displacements.

Mean and standard deviation of displacements versus wind speed for each turbulence intensity category.

# Interpretation of Results

The Turbie exhibits periodic oscillations whose frequency is determined by the combination of mass, stiffness, and damping of the structure. Blade displacements (x1) reach higher peaks than tower/hub displacements (x2) due to direct aerodynamic loading, while damping slightly reduces oscillation amplitudes over time, though this effect is not immediately visible in short periods. Turbulence introduces small random fluctuations, adding variability and “noise” to the response. Overall, the mean oscillation amplitude increases as wind speed approaches the rated value, since the turbine aims to maximize power extraction, generating higher structural loads. Beyond the rated wind speed, the turbine limits power output, reducing rotor speed and consequently decreasing the displacement amplitudes.
